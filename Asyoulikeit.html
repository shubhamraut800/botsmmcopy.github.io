<!--         <p>Ans> In Khushwant singhâ€™s story karma Sir Mohanlal is middle aged barrister who works under the British government he he heats his country man and even his wife Lakshmi. he considered himself as a Englishman and blindly follows the English culture and manners he speaks either in English or anglicised Hindi. he has a spent 5 years in England and studied in Oxford University he proves his British aristocracy through imported the Times newspaper suits from Seville zero and Balliol type is personality and image is full of pride hey regards himself distinct guest efficient and handsome but hey calls Indian indifferent and dirty as his wife Lakshmi is an uneducated native and fat woman hey gives her list important through Mohanlal uses his wife in the time of physical need this pride and arrogance get settled when to English soldiers through him out of the compartment does Sara Mohanlal loses his self identity and becomes the victim of his own karma destiny </p>
        <h2>Q2> Justify the title of the story ?</h2> 
        <p>Ans> The title of the story karma refers to a moral judgement karma is a Sanskrit word which implies action the little reminds us of a proverb*** you saw so you rap in Khushwant Singh short story karma Sara Mohan Lal a middle aged vizier and a barrister desc spices is country mad even his wife Lakshmi hey regard himself as a Englishman and blindly follow English culture and manners is speak either in English or in English sized Hindi the proof is British aristo rasid through English the Times newspaper suit from Seville raw and Balliol die this personality and image is full of pride on the other hand his wife Lakshmi is a short bulky indifferent and native women she wears a dirty red border white saree add very typical Indian ornaments and does not know English C is fond of chewing battle leaves saraymohan pride and arrogance gates settled when to English soldiers throw him out of the compartment the first job consequence off his on karma destiny add loses his own identity but his wife does not face search humility v consequence journey is the smooth the story karma focuses on the justice both Mohanlal and Lakshmi receive their respective the little ironically suggest the theme has the little is app appropriate</p>
        <h2>Q3> Compare and contrast between sir MohanLal and Lakshmi to their attitude .</h2>
        <p>Ans> In the story karma by Khushwant Singh search Mohanlal add his wife Lakshmi where totally opposite characters in every sense Mohanlal a wiser and a barrister he studied in Oxford University he would put oil suit from savil draw with baliola Skype hey could speak English exactly like at English man on the other hand his wife Lakshmi was a typical woman she was sort bulky in her middle fourteens she would there a dirty white saree with red border she's worked in hindustani language Sir mohanlal was very font of following English culture add manners blindly but Lakshmi grow up with Indian culture and tradition add she had no sophisticated manners she left of dairy simple life while Mohanlal was drinking Scotch C at grand chapatis with tell mango pickle besides Mohanlal wood travel in the first class compartment but she would travel in jalana inter class finally Mohanlal was thrown out of the compartment by 2 English soldiers but she said comfortably in the train while his just is on identity Lakshmi did not face search humility eating consequence all these suggest that the couple will accidentally locked together they lived under the same roof but indifferent was there thinking where totally different</p>
