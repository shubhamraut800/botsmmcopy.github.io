        <h2> Q1> Give the substance of the poem “Meeting at night”. Or describe the journey of the lover.</h1>
        <p>Ans>  In an excellent dramatic lyric named “meeting at night” the poet Robert Browning presents a lover’s strong desire to meet with his beloved. The lover starts his journey in a boat on the sea at night because he wants to maintain the secrecy of his love. The sea is grey and the yellow half-moon is in full splendour. Overcoming the danger of the sea and crossing a mile of warm sea-scented beach & then three fields, he ultimately reaches the door of his beloved with great expectation and taps on the window-pane with beating heart to indicate his presence. Suddenly his ‘lady love’ responds with the lighted match and its blue spark / blue light. The suddenness of the blue light presents the condition of their beating heart gives them the aesthetic pleasure of true / real love. Thus, the poet Browning expresses a lover’s passion, urge and impatience to meet with his beloved secretly.</p>
        <h2>Q2> Justify the title of the Poem “Meeting at Night”.</h2>

The lover starts his journey in a boat on the sea at night because he wants to maintain the secrecy of his love. The sea is grey and the yellow half-moon is in full splendour. Overcoming the danger of the sea and crossing a mile of warm sea-scented beach & then three fields, at last he reaches the door of his beloved with great expectation and taps on the window-pane with beating heart to indicate his presence. Suddenly his ‘lady love’ responds in a smooth voice which was full of excitement, joy and fear with the lighted match and its blue spark. The suddenness of the blue light presents the condition of their beating heart gives them the aesthetic pleasure of real love to both of them. The poet Browning expresses a lover’s passion, urge, restlessness to meet his beloved secretly. The whole story is based on a secret meeting at night.

        <h2>Q3> Critically analyse Browning’s poem “Meeting at Night”. Or Critical appreciation of the poem. Or Discus Browning’s use of images and symbols.</h2>
        <p>Ans> Browning, in his dramatic lyric “Meeting at night” uses different types of symbols and images which make the poem very significant with its theme. The uses of visual, auditory, tactile and olfactory images bring out the lover’s passion and great desire for love prominently. He units with his lady love by crossing all the obstructions and overcoming all the adverse situation at the night. The expressions such as ‘grey sea’, ‘black land’, ‘yellow half-moon’, ‘fiery ringlets’, ‘slushy sand’, ‘sea-scented beach’, ‘blue spark of the lighted match’, ‘voice less loud’, ‘heart beating’, present pastoral/natural, landscape, time &place of the journey. There is a dramatic urgency, tension and suspense in their meeting which achieves unspeakable beauty of true love &happiness. The symbols, used in this poem are artistically justified. </p>
